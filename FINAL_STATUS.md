```bash
cd "/Users/stephenchen/Senior Safeguard"
./start-with-tts.sh

**Click:** Microphone button  
**Say:** "What time is it?" or "I need help"

## Voice Quality Note:

The current voice uses macOS compact Samantha because:
- ✅ FREE (no API costs)
- ✅ Better than browser TTS  
- ✅ Works reliably
- ⚠️ Not as natural as premium voices

**To get PREMIUM quality voices (optional):**
1. System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content
2. Look for "Manage Voices" or similar option
3. Download Samantha (Premium) ~300MB
4. Voice will automatically improve

---

## What Works Now:

✅ Voice input (seniors can speak naturally)  
✅ Voice output (Samantha responds)  
✅ AI conversations (GPT-4 powered)  
✅ Task guidance (Zoom, calls, volume, WiFi)  
✅ Scam protection (Sync.me)  
✅ Multilingual (English, Hindi, Chinese, Tamil)  
✅ Senior-optimized (slower pace, clear speech)

---

## For Production:

Consider upgrading to premium voices or OpenAI TTS API for the most caring, natural voice experience that seniors deserve.

**Current setup:** Good enough for development and testing  
**Recommended:** Download premium voices for production use
